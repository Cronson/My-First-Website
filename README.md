# My-First-Website
Programming Web Lecture

Yeah, this is my very first time creating a website.
So, there are 5 page(s) in total that i created, that is index.html,Biodata,Education,Hobbies,Contact.
In index i post like 3 photos in total, and do some styling with rounded photos.

in biodata, i tried some "mute-text" on my Borndate.

on education i only do some simple paragraph.

on Hobbies i use table to classify my favorite movies.

in Contact page, i try to do some href link to my twitter,linkedin, and facebook. but my Logo button is fail to shown. it only shown by
circle. But i success to do some auto-changing color on the circle-button when we drag the mouse. but i didnt know why the logo isnt shown.

So this is my first website, ill do better next time.
